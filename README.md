## Conclusions
- Extra caution should be taken while disbursing loan to borrowers with more liabilities. 
    - Eg: People having monthly debt more than their monthly income are at greater risk of loan default.
    - People with 10+ years of employment experience have loan liabilities
- The disbursement of the loan should occur solely subsequent to validating the source of income. For instance, within the low-income group(monthly income<= 4000/month), there exists a considerable quantity of unverified income sources that necessitate verification.
- Loan disbursement process for purposes such as debt consolidation, small business should be made stricter and should be disbursed only if borrower has a stable source of income.
- The interest rates offered for low income group should be re-visited.
- Avoid offering loans to borrowers with rented or mortgaged home ownership as these are the ones to default most of the times.
